For those who are confused with ans += right - left + 1 in "Sliding Window" approach. Because the element pointed by the "right" is the new one we are investigating, as long as we find a subarray with prod < k after being divided by nums[left], ans should be increased by the length of the subarray because the product is ever increasing. For example, [10,5,2,6], when right points to 6, left points to 5, ans added 3, which is due to [5,2,6],[2.6],and[6].
