Formula: If a sorted array is shifted, if you take the middle, always one side will be sorted. Take the recursion according to that rule.
â€‹
1- take the middle and compare with target, if matches return.
2- if middle is bigger than left side, it means left is sorted
2a- if [left] < target < [middle] then do recursion with left, middle - 1 (right)
2b- left side is sorted, but target not in here, search on right side middle + 1 (left), right
3- if middle is less than right side, it means right is sorted
3a- if [middle] < target < [right] then do recursion with middle + 1 (left), right
3b- right side is sorted, but target not in here, search on left side left, middle -1 (right)
